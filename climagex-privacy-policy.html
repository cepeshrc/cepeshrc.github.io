    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"></i> Privacy Policy for Climagex</h1>
    <p class="meta-info">
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 10, 2025
    </p>

    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "Climagex: Advanced Image Downloader - One Click Bulk Save Pictures" browser extension ("we," "our," or "the extension") handles your information. Your privacy is our top priority. The extension is designed with a "privacy-first" approach, meaning its core functions operate without collecting or transmitting your personal data to our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>The Climagex extension is built to be secure and private. We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect, view, store, or transmit any of your personal information, browsing history, website content (except for image URLs as described below), or any data you enter into forms on any webpage.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Image and URL Processing</h2>
    <p>To provide its core functionality, the extension must interact with the content of the web pages you visit. This is necessary for its key features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Detection:</strong> To make images downloadable, the extension's content script scans the page to find image elements (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags).</li>
        <li><strong>URL Retrieval:</strong> For an image to be downloaded, the extension must read its source URL (the <code>src</code> attribute).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This entire process occurs <strong>locally within your browser</strong> on your computer. <strong>At no point are the URLs of the images you view or download ever sent to our servers or any third party.</strong> They are used exclusively to initiate the download process via the browser's API.</p>

    <h2>4. Local Data Storage Only</h2>
    <p>To provide a personalized experience, the extension stores all your settings <strong>locally on your device</strong> using your browser's built-in, secure storage API (<code>chrome.storage.sync</code>). This data is under your control and never leaves your computer. This locally stored data includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your chosen interaction method ("Cursor Mode" or "Hover Button").</li>
        <li>Your custom download subfolder path.</li>
        <li>Your preferences for file naming (e.g., sequential naming, custom templates).</li>
        <li>Your image size filters (minimum width and height).</li>
        <li>The enabled/disabled status of the extension.</li>
        <li>Your chosen theme (light/dark).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Paid Subscriptions & Third-Party Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>To unlock VIP Features, you can purchase a subscription. We use a secure third-party service, ExtensionPay (which utilizes <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>), to process payments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you choose to purchase a subscription, you will be directed to a secure payment page hosted by our payment processor.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect, view, or store your sensitive payment information, such as your full credit card number.</li>
        <li>We only receive non-sensitive information necessary to manage your subscription, such as your email address (if provided to the payment processor), the plan you purchased, and your subscription status (e.g., active, canceled). This information is used solely for account management and to provide you with access to VIP Features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policy of our payment processor: <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Permissions Explained</h2>
    <p>Climagex requests the minimum permissions necessary for its functionality. Here is a transparent explanation of why each one is needed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>storage</code>:</strong> Essential to save your settings, such as your interaction method, download folder, and naming preferences, locally and securely in your browser.</li>
        <li><strong><code>downloads</code>:</strong> Required for the core functionality: to use the browser's download API to save images from a URL to your computer.</li>
        <li><strong><code>notifications</code>:</strong> Used to display helpful system notifications, such as a confirmation when a bulk download is complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Host Permission (<code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code>):</strong> This permission is necessary for the extension to find images and enable download functions (Cursor Mode, Hover Button) on <strong>any</strong> website you visit. The extension <strong>does not</strong> read the text content of these pages, track your browsing activity, or record your history. Its access is limited to identifying image elements for download purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer any of your data, <strong>with the sole exception of the data required for payment processing as described in Section 5.</strong> The extension does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data. You can view, modify, and delete your saved settings at any time within the extension's popup or options page. Uninstalling the extension will permanently remove all of its locally stored data from your browser.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make any significant changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document and may provide a notice on the extension's listing in the respective browser stores.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:luciscepesh@gmail.com">luciscepesh@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"></i> Privacy Policy for DefendTab</h1>
    <p class="meta-info">
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 30, 2025
    </p>

    <h2>1. Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "DefendTab: Don't Close My Tab" browser extension ("we," "our," or "the extension") handles your information. Your privacy is our top priority. The extension is designed with a "privacy-first" approach, meaning its core functions operate without collecting or transmitting your personal data to our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>The DefendTab extension is built to be secure and private. We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect, view, store, or transmit any of your personal information, browsing history, website content, or any data you enter into forms on any webpage.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Tab Interaction and URL Processing</h2>
    <p>To provide its core functionality, the extension must access the URL of your tabs. This is necessary for two key features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exception List:</strong> To check if a website should be protected, the extension compares the tab's URL against your personal exception list.</li>
        <li><strong>Undo Close Tab:</strong> To inform you which tab was just closed, the extension's notification includes the URL of that tab.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This entire process occurs <strong>locally within your browser</strong> on your computer. <strong>At no point are your tab URLs or browsing history ever sent to our servers or any third party.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Local Data Storage Only</h2>
    <p>To provide a personalized experience, the extension stores all your settings <strong>locally on your device</strong> using your browser's built-in, secure storage API (<code>chrome.storage.sync</code> and <code>chrome.storage.local</code>). This data is under your control and never leaves your computer. This locally stored data includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your list of websites added to the exceptions list.</li>
        <li>Your preferences for features like "Undo Close Tab" and the "Active Protection" badge.</li>
        <li>Information about temporarily protected tabs and their expiration times.</li>
        <li>The enabled/disabled status of the extension.</li>
        <li>Your chosen theme (light/dark).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Paid Subscriptions & Third-Party Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>To unlock VIP Features, you can purchase a subscription. We use a secure third-party service, ExtensionPay (which utilizes <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>), to process payments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you choose to purchase a subscription, you will be directed to a secure payment page hosted by our payment processor.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect, view, or store your sensitive payment information, such as your full credit card number.</li>
        <li>We only receive non-sensitive information necessary to manage your subscription, such as your email address, the plan you purchased, and your subscription status (e.g., active, canceled). This information is used solely for account management and to provide you with access to VIP Features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policy of our payment processor: <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Permissions Explained</h2>
    <p>DefendTab requests the minimum permissions necessary for its functionality. Here is a transparent explanation of why each one is needed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>storage</code>:</strong> Essential to save your settings, such as your exception list and feature preferences, locally and securely in your browser.</li>
        <li><strong><code>tabs</code>:</strong> Required for the core functionality: detecting when you try to close a tab, getting a tab's URL to check against your exception list, and identifying a recently closed tab to offer the "Undo" option.</li>
        <li><strong><code>notifications</code>:</strong> Used to display helpful system notifications, such as the "Undo Close Tab" prompt after a tab is closed, or confirmation when a site is added to exceptions via a hotkey.</li>
        <li><strong><code>sessions</code>:</strong> Needed to restore a recently closed browser tab when you click the "Undo" button in the notification.</li>
        <li><strong><code>contextMenus</code>:</strong> Allows us to add the "Protect this tab for..." option to your browser's right-click menu for convenience.</li>
        <li><strong><code>alarms</code>:</strong> Used to run a periodic check (approximately once per minute) to remove protection from tabs where the temporary timer has expired. This is an efficient background task that respects your computer's resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Host Permission (<code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code>):</strong> This permission is necessary for the extension to protect <strong>any</strong> tab you might close, regardless of the website. It also allows the extension to show the on-page "Active Protection" badge (a VIP feature). The extension <strong>does not</strong> read the content of these pages or track your browsing activity. It only accesses the URL when needed for the features described in Section 3.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer any of your data, <strong>with the sole exception of the data required for payment processing as described in Section 5.</strong> The extension does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Your Control Over Your Data</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data. You can view, modify, and delete your saved settings at any time within the extension's popup window. Uninstalling the extension will permanently remove all of its locally stored data from your browser.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make any significant changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document and may provide a notice on the extension's listing in the respective browser stores.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:luciscepesh@gmail.com">luciscepesh@gmail.com</a>.</p>
